### Housing Prices Study: Optimizing Construction Project Outcomes with AI

#### Overview
This project, conducted by the San Diego County Taxpayers Association (SDCTA), aims to develop a system for evaluating taxpayer-funded school construction projects. The system assesses projects against a detailed rubric using AI-driven data extraction and analysis to ensure effective and efficient execution that benefits both students and taxpayers.

#### Key Components
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes libraries such as `pdfplumber`, `pytesseract`, `pandas`, and `PIL` for processing PDF documents, extracting text and images, and handling data.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 model to automate the extraction of quantitative data from project documents, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of evaluations.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Budget and Costs**: Evaluates whether construction costs stay within budget.
- **Change Orders**: Assesses the rate and management of change orders.
- **Procurement Efficiency**: Analyzes the procurement processes for contractors and services.
- **Project Management**: Reviews the workload and oversight of project managers.
- **Transparency and Governance**: Monitors documentation and involvement of governance bodies.
- **Alignment with Bond Criteria**: Measures adherence to the master plan and bond spending accuracy.

#### Challenges and Solutions
- **Previous Code Challenges**: Addressed issues with inconsistent text and image extraction, and inefficient keyword extraction.
- **Benefits of GPT-4 Integration**: Improved accuracy in keyword extraction, streamlined data extraction processes, and enhanced KPI calculation capabilities.

#### Expected Deliverables
- **Method Development**: A robust method to extract and evaluate data, assess compliance with standards, and measure overall project performance.
- **Business Impact**: The project aims to provide actionable insights to improve construction project outcomes, ultimately enhancing planning, execution, and policy-making.

#### Conclusion
This GitHub repository documents the development and implementation of an AI-driven system to optimize the management of school construction projects, demonstrating significant improvements in project evaluation and oversight.
